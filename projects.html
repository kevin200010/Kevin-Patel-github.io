							<h3> Summary </h3>
							<h4><b>1. Developing Model For Facial Emotion Detection:</b></h4>
							<p>First, I developed a model for facial emotion detection, which involved two crucial
								steps:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p> Step 1: I utilized a Haar Cascade feature-based classifier to detect faces in
										images.
										This initial step allowed me to locate and isolate facial regions accurately.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> Step 2: I employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion detection.
										My CNN
										model architecture comprised six convolutional layers followed by three dense
										layers.
										These convolutional layers had varying feature sizes, and the dense layers
										included
										different numbers of nodes.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>For training this model, I utilized the FER-13 dataset, which contains data for four
								facial expressions: Angry, Happy, Sad, and Surprised. </p>
							<p> The outcome of my efforts was an 83% accuracy in facial emotion recognition, with a loss
								of 0.4532.</p>

							<br>
							<h4><b>2. Collecting User Past History Using APIs:</b></h4>
							<p>In the second part of the project, I collected user data and their historical music
								listening records using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). I set up connections
								with these APIs, likely from music streaming platforms or databases, to gather
								user-specific information</p>

							<br>
							<h4><b>3. Song Mood Classification:</b></h4>
							<p>Moving on to the third component, I designed a system for classifying the mood of songs.
								The process involved:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Creating a Sequential Model for song mood classification, following common deep
									learning practices.</li>
								<li>Utilizing the KerasClassifier to encapsulate my Sequential Model as a function.</li>
								<li>Selecting ten relevant attributes, including song features like Length,
									Danceability, Acousticness, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, Loudness,
									Speechiness, and Tempo, which I found useful for mood prediction.</li>
								<li>Designing a Sequential Neural Network with four layers, each with various neuron
									configurations.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The model I created achieved an accuracy of 83% for song mood classification, considering
								four distinct mood classes: Calm Song, Happy Song, Energetic Song, and Sad Song. The
								dataset I used for this task was sourced from Spotify and contained over 800 songs with
								diverse attributes.</p>
							<p>
								In summary, I divided the project into well-defined components. In the first part, I
								focused on facial emotion detection using a CNN, and I achieved an 83% accuracy. The
								second part involved collecting user data through APIs, and the third part concentrated
								on song mood classification with a deep learning approach, also achieving an 83%
								accuracy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of my machine learning techniques
								in providing personalized music recommendations based on user emotions and song
								attributes.

							<h3> Summary </h3>
							<p> I first preprocessed the textual data by converting sentences to lowercase, removing special
								characters and numbers, and adding starting and ending tags to indicate the beginning and end
								of a sentence. I then used transfer learning to extract features from images using the ResNet50
								and DenseNet201 convolutional neural networks. These features were combined with the
								preprocessed textual data and fed into a recurrent neural network model consisting of an LSTM
								layer and a fully connected output layer with a softmax activation function. </p>
							<p> The hyperparameters of the model, such as the embedding size, LSTM units, dense units, learning
								rate, and batch size, are tuned using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework.
								</p>
							<p>The model was trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and RMSprop optimizer
								for 200 epochs. The final model achieved a validation accuracy of around 0.87, which indicates that
								the model is able to generate captions that are somewhat similar to the ground truth captions for
								the input images

							<h3> Summary </h3>
							<!-- <p> DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models) is a type of generative model that can
								learn to generate realistic images by estimating the probability distribution of the
								data. DDPMs use a diffusion process to transform a random noise signal into an image
								that is close to the target distribution. In the diffusion process, noise is gradually
								added to the signal, and the signal is then denoised using a neural network. By
								iteratively adding noise and denoising, the model can learn to generate high-quality
								images that match the target distribution.</p>
							<p> Stable diffusion is a modification of the diffusion process used in DDPMs to improve
								their stability and performance. In stable diffusion, the amount of noise added to the
								signal is adaptively adjusted at each step to ensure that the signal remains close to
								the target distribution. This adaptation is done by monitoring the signal's gradient and
								scaling the noise accordingly. Stable diffusion can help avoid numerical instability and
								ensure that the diffusion process converges to the target distribution efficiently.</p>
							<p> In this project, a diffusion model was trained using Hugging Face's diffusers library to
								generate stunning butterfly images. To improve the quality of the images generated by
								the diffusion model, a UNet architecture was trained for denoising using a noise
								scheduler that added noise to 1000 clean butterfly images. The backward denoising
								process was implemented using the AdamW optimizer and the mean squared error (MSE) loss
								function to update the model parameters. Overall, this approach allowed for the
								generation of visually impressive butterfly images with improved quality and clarity.

							<h3> Summary </h3>
							<p> In recent years, deep learning has shown promising results in medical image analysis,
								including detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays. One popular approach is to use
								pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, such as VGG-16, ResNet, or
								DenseNet, and fine-tune them on COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets. The fine-tuning process
								involves removing the original classification layer and adding a new one to adapt the
								model to the specific COVID-19 detection task.</p>
							<p> Besides using pre-trained models, researchers have also developed specialized
								architectures for COVID-19 detection. For example, COVID-Net is a CNN model specifically
								designed for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays. COVID-Net uses a series of
								convolutional and pooling layers followed by several fully-connected layers to classify
								chest X-rays as normal, pneumonia, or COVID-19.</p>
							<p> The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately and
								quickly detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. By achieving an accuracy of
								93%, the model shows promise as a potential tool for COVID-19 screening and diagnosis.

							<h3> Summary </h3>

							<p>Statistical analysis is a collection of techniques used to analyze data in order to draw
								meaningful conclusions and insights from it. It involves collecting, organizing,
								analyzing, and interpreting data using mathematical and statistical methods. Statistical
								analysis is widely used in various fields such as business, economics, social sciences,
								medicine, and engineering, among others. It allows researchers to test hypotheses, make
								predictions, and estimate probabilities. Some common statistical techniques include
								descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, analysis of variance,
								and factor analysis, among others. Proper statistical analysis is crucial for making
								informed decisions based on data and ensuring that the results are reliable and
								accurate.</p>
							<p>This project describes two statistical analyses that were conducted. The first analysis
								was a Multiple Linear Regression, which aimed to predict employment test percentage
								based on high school, secondary education, and degree percentages. The second analysis
								was a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which was used to compare the mean
								employment test percentage between male and female groups. The ANOVA was performed to
								determine whether there was a significant difference in employment test scores between
								males and females. These statistical analyses are useful for identifying patterns and
								relationships in data, and for making informed decisions based on the results.</p>
